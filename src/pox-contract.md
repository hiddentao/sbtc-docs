# The PoX Contract
The [PoX Contract](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity/noteworthy-contracts/stacking-contract) is used by Stackers to lock their STX in order to receive BTC rewards.
In sBTC the PoX contract is extended to also do the following.

- Mint and burn sBTC tokens.
- More things?


Explanation of the PoX contracts and it's public functions. It should be clear which functions a user would interact with, which ones are used by stackers, and which ones that are called as part of Stacks consensus (sBTC mint/burn).
