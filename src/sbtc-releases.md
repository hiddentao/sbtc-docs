# sBTC Releases
Since sBTC is a complex system, we have defined multiple releases of the system to incrementally add functionality and grow the complexity of the system. The releases are:

- sBTC Alpha: A custodial first version.
- sBTC Mini: A decentralized version without consensus breaking changes.
- sBTC MVP: A minimal version emulating the full system.
- sBTC 1.0: The complete system.

The following table highlights the main differences between the releases
