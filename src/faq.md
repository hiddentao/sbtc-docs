# FAQ

Ideally we are able to fit all questions into their relevant sections, but this will serve as a fallback in case we need it.

Strongly prefer not needing this section and effectively organizing information into relevant sections. FAQs can become bloated catch-alls when a better option may be to put some more effort into information architecture.
