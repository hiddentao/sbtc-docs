# Developer Release

[The sBTC Developer Release](./sbtc-releases/sbtc-dev.md) is a minimum-viable testnet deployment of sBTC and was decided to be released without the complexity of adding a decentralized set of signers to validate sBTC deposits/withdrawals.

Therefore our beloved Developer Release aka Version 0.1 Alpha Romeo won't have signer when deployed to public test net.
