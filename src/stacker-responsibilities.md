# Stacker responsibilities
The stackers are gaining a lot of responsibilities in sBTC. This chapter should outline the new role of the stackers, and also provide a high level interaction to further details on how this is implemented.

Important areas to introduce:
- The sBTC wallet and how stackers maintain it (introducing FROST)
- How stackers communicate (Signing protocol + StackerDB)
